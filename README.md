Hi Humans
I believe coding is wonderful and many can be done with right coding and programming. The world of coding and programming can do wonders for modern civilization and humans. From touching lives and making credible data analysis that can help people to find out possible cures for a lot of diseases that can contribute to human deaths, to creating a self-sustaing artifical intelligence system that can drive a car in a non coordinated interface. This wonderful cretion of charles babbage can actually change the world if it is done correctly.
